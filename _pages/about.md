I am a researcher at the [Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/) working at the intersection of mechanics, applied physics, and computer science.

> *My work focuses on **understanding** and **designing** structure--function relationships in **material architectures** to harness **nonlinearities** for functionalities.*
