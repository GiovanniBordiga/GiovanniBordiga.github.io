I am a researcher at the [Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/) working at the intersection of applied physics, mechanics, and computer science.

> My work focuses on developing understanding and design strategies at the nexus of structureâ€“function relationships in material architectures to directly harness nonlinearities and instabilities for functionalities.
